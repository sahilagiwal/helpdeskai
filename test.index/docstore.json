Campus MFP Program - Printing, Copying, Scanning and Faxing Services Delete Juniata leverages an MFP (Multi-Function Printer) program that is centrally managed by Information Technology Services (ITS) to support campus wide printing, copying, scanning, and faxing services. Toshiba hardware is placed throughout key locations across campus to enable convenient access to services. PaperCut software is deployed to enable printing through a variety of solutions that are aligned to community needs. Juniata partners with DOCEO to provide hardware and software support for the MFP program. Juniata values information security and environmental sustainability.
